## **Installation Process**

Follow the steps below to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **1. Install Python:**

First, ensure that Python is installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet:

- Download Python from the official website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **Install Python 3.x** (make sure to check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** during installation).
- Verify the installation by running the following command in the terminal/command prompt:

```bash
python --version
```

If Python is installed correctly, it will return the version (e.g., Python 3.x.x).

### **2. Install Dependencies:**

#### **Install OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI:**

These are the essential libraries required for the project:

1. **OpenCV**: For video capture and image processing.
2. **MediaPipe**: For hand tracking and gesture recognition.
3. **PyAutoGUI**: For controlling the mouse and keyboard.

To install the required dependencies, use `pip`, Python's package installer.

1. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended):**

   This keeps your project dependencies isolated.

   - To create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   ```

   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - **Windows**:

     ```bash
     myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     - **macOS/Linux**:

     ```bash
     source myenv/bin/activate
     ```

2. **Install the required libraries** using `pip`:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui
```

Alternatively, if you prefer to install all dependencies from a **requirements.txt** file (recommended for GitHub repos), you can create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:

```txt
opencv-python
mediapipe
pyautogui
```

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3. Verify Installation:**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can check if the installation was successful by importing them in Python:

```python
import cv2
import mediapipe as mp
import pyautogui
```

If there are no errors, then everything is set up correctly.

### **4. Run the Project:**

Now that the dependencies are installed, you can run the project:

1. Download or clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gesture-control-game.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd gesture-control-game
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python gesture_control.py
```

This will open the webcam and start the gesture control for your game.
